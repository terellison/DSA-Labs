# Data Structures and Algorithms Labs

---

These are my lab submissions for Data Structures and Algorithms at Full Sail University, while taking the course in August 2022.

There are several custom implementations of common data structures, each accompanied by a seperate lab using its STL counterpart.

For each lab, we are provided with pre-made header files. We then fill them in with our own implementation. There is also a test harness provided, which can be toggled on / off in each corresponding header file.

## Contents

- [DynArray.h](DSA%20Labs/DynArray.h)

    * Represents a dynamically allocated, resizeable array. Analog to ```std::vector<>``` in [Lab2.h](DSA%20Labs/Lab2.h)
    
- [DList.h](DSA%20Labs/DList.h)

    * Doubly linked list, with custom iterator. Analog to ```std::list<>``` in Lab4.h

- [Dictionary.h](DSA%20Labs/Dictionary.h)

    * A hash-mapped data structure using key/value pairs and separate chaining. Analog to ```std::unordered_map<>``` in Lab6.h
